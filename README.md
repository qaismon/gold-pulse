Trade-Pulse Pro: AI-Driven Scalping TerminalTrade-Pulse Pro is a high-frequency trading decision engine designed for the modern crypto scalp-trader. By merging real-time data from the Binance API with the analytical power of the TradingView charting suite, this terminal transforms raw market volatility into actionable, mathematically-backed trade setups.Core FunctionalityLive Market Analysis: The app executes a "Deep Scan" of the Bitcoin (BTC/USDT) market every 30 seconds. It fetches the most recent 100-minute candlesticks to analyze current momentum and trend strength.Dual-Confirmation Logic: To filter out false signals (fakeouts), the engine utilizes a Confluence Model:RSI (Relative Strength Index): Identifies if the market is overextended (Overbought/Oversold).EMA 20 (Exponential Moving Average): Confirms the short-term trend direction to ensure you aren't "fighting the tape."Automated Scalp Architect: The terminal doesn't just give a "Buy" or "Sell" signal; it builds a complete Position Architecture. It automatically calculates tight scalping parameters ($0.25\%$ Stop-Loss and $0.75\%$ Take-Profit) to maintain a professional 1:3 Risk-to-Reward ratio.Key FeaturesIntegrated Live Charting: Features a fully interactive TradingView candlestick chart, allowing you to visually verify the signals generated by the AI.Real-Time Risk Management: Includes a dynamic Position Sizer. Input your wallet balance, and the app calculates the exact amount of BTC to trade so that you never risk more than $1\%$ of your capital on a single execution.Autonomous Refresh: A built-in countdown timer ensures the data is never stale. Every 30 seconds, the "Heartbeat" pulse triggers a fresh analysis of the order books.Terminal Aesthetic: A high-contrast, dark-mode UI designed for low eye strain during long trading sessions, featuring a color-coded status screen (Green for Bullish, Red for Bearish, Amber for Neutral).
